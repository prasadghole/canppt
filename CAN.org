* Introduction
The CAN bus was developed bu BOSCH as a multi master, message broadcast system that specifies
maximum 1 megabit per seconds (bps) of speed.


* ISO 11898 Standard
CAN is an international standardization Organization (ISO) defined serial communication bus
originally developed for automotive industry to replace complex and expensive wiring harness
with two wire bus. The specification call for high immunity to electrical interference and 
the ability to self-diagnose and repair data errors.

The CAN communication protocol, ISO-11898: 2003, describes how information is passed between
devices on network and conforms to the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model.

ISO 11898 defines data link and physical layer only.

Application layer is mostly defined by various industrial bodies like 
- CANOpen by CAN in Automation (CiA)
- KVASER CAN Kingdom by Kvaser
- DeviceNet by Rockwell automation

* Standard CAN frame

* Extended CAN frame
[[./img/extcan.png]]

* Need for Application layer standards
As the CAN standard only provide basis for communication only but do not specify things
like 
- How to decode payload 
- How to trasport data more than 64 bytes

* SAE J1939
Is standard used in heavy-duty vehicles like 
- Mining vehicles
- Military vehicles
- Agriculture

* SAE J1939
- Support 29 bit extended ID
- 250K baud rate
- Parameter Group Numbers (PGN) (standard and use specific)
- Suspect Parameter Number (SPN)
- Dynamic 8 bit address assignment to nodes.
- Data conversion is possilbe across multiple manufacturers

* Parameter Group Number (PGN)
It is 18 bit subset of 29 bit-extended CAN ID.

* OBD2
On board diagnostics is a self-diagnostic and reporting. It provide diagnostic trouble codes
(DTCs) and real time vehicle parameters data using standard ports.

* UDS 
Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) is a communication protocol used to diagnost, firmware update
and routine testing.

The UDS protocol (ISO 14229) is standardizedc across manufacturers. It is a client server 
protocol with test tool being client and ECU being server.

Use cases
- Read diagnostic codes
- Read vehicle parameters
- Diagnostic
- Update firmware and settings
- Secure access

* CAN ISO-TP
Classiscal and extended CAN support maximum 8 and 64 bytes in one communication frame.
Diagnostic and firmware upgrade require larger payload. ISO-TP provide facility to extend CAN payload
upto 4095 bytes using segmentation, flow control and reassembly.

* CAN Open
Is mostly used in industrial automation.


* DBC Files
CAN DBC CAN database is a text file decribing how to decode raw CAN but data to physical values.


* CAN Errors
* Tools
* DBC Tools
- Vector CANDB++
- Kvaser Database editor
- canmatrix
- 
* Bus Transceivers
* Analysers

LIN 
- Low cost alternative to CAN bus
- Mostly used for window, wiper, air condition low time constrained actuators
- Master slave configuration
- Single wirr with 1-20 Kbit/s 
- Time triggered scheduling with guaranteed latency time
- Variable data length (2,4,8)
- Error detection
- Configuration
- 12 Voltage operating mode
- Sleep and wake support for power saving
